# NebulaGraph Exchange
 [中文版](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-exchange/blob/master/README-CN.md)

NebulaGraph Exchange (referred to as Exchange) is an Apache Spark™ application used to migrate data in bulk from different sources to NebulaGraph in a distributed way(Spark). It supports a variety of batch or streaming data sources and allows direct writing to NebulaGraph through side-loading (SST Files).

Exchange supports Spark versions 2.2, 2.4, and 3.0 along with their respective toolkits named: `nebula-exchange_spark_2.2`, `nebula-exchange_spark_2.4`, and `nebula-exchange_spark_3.0`.

> Note:
> - Exchange 3.4.0 does not support Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar. Please use Exchange of version 3.0.0, 3.3.0, or 3.5.0 to load data from Apache Kafka or Apache Pulsar to NebulaGraph for now.
> - This repo covers only NebulaGraph 2.x and 3.x, for NebulaGraph v1.x, please use [NebulaGraph Exchange v1.0](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-java/tree/v1.0/tools/exchange).

## Build or Download Exchange

1. Build the latest Exchange

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-exchange.git
    $ cd nebula-exchange
    $ mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dgpg.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -pl nebula-exchange_spark_2.2 -am -Pscala-2.11 -Pspark-2.2
    $ mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dgpg.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -pl nebula-exchange_spark_2.4 -am -Pscala-2.11 -Pspark-2.4
    $ mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dgpg.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -pl nebula-exchange_spark_3.0 -am -Pscala-2.12 -Pspark-3.0
    ```

    After packaging, the newly generated JAR files can be found in the following path:
    - nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange_spark_2.2/target/ contains nebula-exchange_spark_2.2-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    - nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange_spark_2.4/target/ contains nebula-exchange_spark_2.4-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    - nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange_spark_3.0/target/ contains nebula-exchange_spark_3.0-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Get Started

Here is an example command to run the Exchange:

```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange --master local nebula-exchange_spark_2.4-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -c /path/to/application.conf
```

And when the source is **Hive**, run:

```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange --master local nebula-exchange_spark_2.4-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -c /path/to/application.conf -h
```

Run the Exchange in **Yarn-Cluster** mode:

```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange \
--master yarn-cluster \
--files application.conf \
--conf spark.driver.extraClassPath=./ \
--conf spark.executor.extraClassPath=./ \
nebula-exchange_spark_2.4-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
-c application.conf
```

Note: When using Exchange to generate SST files, please add `spark.sql.shuffle.partition` in `--conf` for Spark's shuffle operation:

```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange \
--master local \
--conf spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=200 \
nebula-exchange_spark_2.4-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
-c application.conf
```
