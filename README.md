# Nebula Exchange 2.0
 [中文版](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-exchange/blob/master/README-CN.md)
 
Nebula Exchange (Exchange for short) is an Apache Spark application. It is used to migrate cluster data in bulk from Spark to Nebula Graph in a distributed environment. It supports migration of batch data and streaming data in various formats.

Exchange 2.0 only supports Nebula Graph 2.0 . If you want to import data for Nebula Graph v1.x，please use [Nebula Exchange v1.0](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-java/tree/v1.0/tools/exchange).

## How to get

1. Package latest Exchange

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-exchange.git
    $ cd nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange
    $ mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dgpg.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
    ```

    After the packaging, you can see the newly generated nebula-exchange-2.5-SNAPSHOT.jar under the nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/ directory.

--conf spark.executor.extraClassPath=./ \
nebula-exchange-2.5.0.jar \
-c application.conf
```

Note: When use Exchange to generate SST files, please add spark.sql.shuffle.partition config for Spark's shuffle operation:
```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange \
--master local \
--conf spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=200 \
nebula-exchange-2.5.0.jar \
-c application.conf
```
